        "Short Abstract: This talk covers the simulation technique for a multimachine power system, primarily focusing on the current balance method. This technique aids in dynamic analysis of power systems by considering the modeling of all synchronous generators. Additionally, the presentation will discuss the nature of low-frequency oscillations (LFOs) based on the designed model, with particular emphasis on inter-area oscillation (IAO) damping. To address IAO modes, a two-stage lead-lag power system design, based on IEEE standard power systems, will also be covered."

        "Shor Abstract: nverter-Based Resources (IBRs) are increasingly being integrated into existing power transmission and distribution systems. While much research has been done on modeling, analyzing, and controlling IBRs in balanced systems, there is a lack of similar work for unbalanced systems. With grid codes becoming stricter for fault ride-through and the commonality of unbalanced faults, this talk will explore the challenges, possible solutions, and future research directions for standardizing IBR response in coordination with other control and protection systems."
